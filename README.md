# passport-apple-id

[Passport](http://passportjs.org/) strategy for authenticating with [Apple ID](https://appleid.apple.com/) using the OAuth 2.0 API.

This module lets you authenticate using ["Sign in with Apple"](https://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple/) in your Node.js applications. By plugging into [Passport](http://passportjs.org/), Apple ID authentication can be easily and unobtrusively integrated into any application or framework that supports [Connect](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/)-style middleware, including [Express](http://expressjs.com/).
